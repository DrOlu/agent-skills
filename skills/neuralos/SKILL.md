Use this skill whenever the user brings data of any kind (databases, log files, CSV/TSV, JSON/JSONL, REST APIs, spreadsheets, transaction dumps, unstructured text, directories of files) and wants it parsed, modeled, queried, monitored, or wired into an on-device tool-calling agent; whenever they say "build a neuralOS instance for this data", "build a needle instance" (the historical CLI name), "parse this in real time", "give me a Pydantic model for this", "profile this data source", "make this queryable in plain English", "hook this data into neuralOS/needle", or "add relationships/graph probes"; whenever a new data source appears in a project and needs schema discovery, type inference, relationship/edge discovery, regex/log-template synthesis, or a query bridge; whenever the target is a Windows/PowerShell-only environment; and whenever an existing neuralOS instance or menu must be extended to cover a new table, feed, or file format.

# neuralOS Data — profile any source, generate its neuralOS instance

This skill converts **any data source** into three deliverables, generated
from what the data actually contains:

1. a **strict Pydantic model** (`models.py`) that captures every attribute the
   data exposes — typed, constrained, nullable where the data is nullable;
2. a **neuralOS instance** (`needle_menu.json` + bridge + agent) that parses and
   queries that data in real time through on-device tool calling;
3. a **relationship layer** (`graph_edges.json` + ≤3 graph probes) that makes
   cross-entity joins first-class, with provenance on every edge and honest
   reporting when joins are impossible.

Nothing is assumed from file names or guesses: every field, type, range,
pattern and enum value comes from **profiling the data first**.

(The on-device CLI/runtime keeps the historical `needle` name — the `needle`
binary, the `needle` python package, `needle_menu.json` and `@needle.tool`
are code-level identifiers and stay as they are. All prose and docs say
**neuralOS**.)

## The four-phase workflow

```
PROFILE ──► MODEL ──► GENERATE ──► VERIFY
(profile_data.py)  (gen_pydantic.py)  (gen_needle_instance.py)  (run against real data)
            + discover_relationships.py          + graph gate
```

Run all four, in order, every time. Skipping VERIFY is the most common failure.

### Phase 1 — PROFILE

```bash
python scripts/profile_data.py --source <SOURCE> [--table NAME] [--sample 50] --out profile.json
```

`<SOURCE>` is anything: a file path (`data.csv`, `app.log`, `events.jsonl`,
`dump.json`, `table.xlsx`, `db.sqlite`), a database DSN (`mysql://user:pw@host/db`,
`postgres://…`, `sqlite:///path.db` — database profiling runs through the
`usql` CLI when present), or an `https://` URL (fetched, then sniffed).

The profiler detects the source kind automatically, samples real records, and
emits `profile.json`: per-field names, inferred Python types, nullability,
min/max, length bounds, distinct counts, enum candidates, sample values, and —
for log sources — synthesized line templates with capture regexes. Database
declarations win over samples: a DB-declared `ENUM(...)` is captured
complete, and only strings become enum candidates (datetimes never do).
Databases wider than `--max-tables` (default 32) note their dropped tables
in the profile. See `references/profiler.md` for exactly what it measures
and its limits.

**Then run relationship discovery** (see `references/graph-standards.md`):

```bash
python scripts/discover_relationships.py --profile profile.json --out graph_edges.json
```

This emits the property-graph declaration: nodes, candidate edges with
provenance + confidence tiers (`exact_fk` / `candidate`), and — critically —
`disjoint` findings: column pairs that share a NAME but no values, which must
be reported to the user as data-quality facts, never used as joins.

**Read the profile before modeling it.** Look for: surprising nullability,
fields whose "type" is really an enum, dates stored as strings, columns whose
sample values contain units or prefixes (e.g. `NGN46494.89`), and nested
structures in JSON sources. Flag anything suspicious to the user before
proceeding.

### Phase 2 — MODEL

```bash
python scripts/gen_pydantic.py --profile profile.json --out models.py [--table NAME] [--model-name Transaction]
```

Emits strict Pydantic v2 models: inferred types with `Field` constraints
(`ge/le` from observed min/max, `pattern` from log templates, `Literal`/`Enum`
from low-cardinality strings), `Optional` where nulls occur, datetime fields
with multi-format parsing validators, `extra="forbid"`, and a description per
field carrying its observed statistics. Every field whose source key differs
from its Python name gets `Field(alias="<source key>")` plus
`populate_by_name=True` — rows arrive keyed by the source's own names, and
without the alias the model rejects them all. Standards and the type-mapping
table: `references/pydantic-standards.md`.

**Edit the generated model if the data's meaning demands it** — the generator
knows types and ranges, but only you and the user know that `status_code = 2`
means "In Progress". Add enum labels, rename cryptic columns, then move on.

### Phase 3 — GENERATE

```bash
python scripts/gen_needle_instance.py --profile profile.json --models models.py --out instance_dir \
    [--db-dsn mysql://user:pw@host/db] [--runtime python|engine] [--agent-name myfeed]
```

Emits a ready-to-run instance directory:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `needle_menu.json` | the probe menu: profile / peek / count / query / aggregate entries, arguments constrained from the profile |
| `graph_edges.json` | the relationship layer declaration from Phase 1 (nodes, typed edges, disjoint findings) |
| `graph_bridge.py` | runtime graph layer (copy from `scripts/graph_bridge.py`): overview / neighbors / connect over parsed records, built at fetch time |
| `bridge.py` | retrieval + parsing: reads the real source (file, DSN, API) and validates every record through the Pydantic models |
| `instance.py` | the neuralOS agent: menu loaded, triggers set, agentic loop wired, example asks included |
| `README.md` | how to run it, what to ask it, how to extend it |

Generation follows the hard rules in `references/instance-standards.md`
(triggers mandatory, arguments constrained in the grammar, results kept small
via digest+stash, secrets baked into the executor only, read-only probes
first) and `references/graph-standards.md` (≤3 graph probes, provenance on
every edge, disjoint honesty, per-fetch construction). For unstructured text
sources the generated bridge uses the model's
structured-extraction capability with the Pydantic schema — see
`references/sources-unstructured.md`.

### Phase 4 — VERIFY

Never deliver unverified:

1. **Model coverage** — run the generated `bridge` over a real sample: report
   the % of records that parse through the Pydantic model without error.
   Below ~95% means the model is too strict or the data is dirtier than the
   sample showed — widen constraints or add validators, then re-check.
2. **Selection test** — ask the generated instance the same question three
   ways (e.g. "how many…", "count…", "show me the number of…"). All three
   must select the intended probe. **After adding graph probes, re-run the
   FULL selection suite** — new menu entries can degrade existing picks.
3. **Truth check** — compare one relayed number against a direct query of the
   source. The data layer is the only oracle.
4. **Graph gate** (see `references/graph-standards.md`): every `exact_fk`
   edge's matched-pair count equals a direct source join count; every
   `disjoint` finding appears in a `graph_overview` digest (a graph that
   hides isolation is a bug); one dangling reference verified against the
   raw source; selection of the three graph probes included in the suite.

## Source routing

| Source | Retrieval method | Profiler path | Probe set generated |
|---|---|---|---|
| SQL database | `usql` CLI (any DSN) or `sqlite3` | DSN → information_schema + samples | count / query / aggregate per table |
| CSV / TSV / delimited | direct read, dialect sniffed | path → column inference | peek / filter / count / aggregate |
| JSON / JSONL / NDJSON | direct read, flatten nested | path → schema induction | peek / filter / count |
| Log files (any line format) | direct read, template synthesis | path → templates + capture regexes | parse_tail / count_by_level / search |
| REST API | HTTP + baked auth | URL fetch → sniff (JSON/CSV/text) | endpoint probes per resource |
| Spreadsheets | openpyxl if available | path → sheet/columns | peek / filter per sheet |
| Unstructured text | read + extraction schema | path → templates | extract(record_text) via model |
| Directories of files | iterate + per-file sniff | glob → combined profile | per-file-pattern probes |

Details, edge cases and failure modes per source: `references/sources-files.md`,
`references/sources-databases.md`, `references/sources-apis.md`,
`references/sources-unstructured.md`.

## Instance runtime choice

- **Python runtime** (`--runtime python`, default): the generated
  `instance.py` runs the agentic loop in-process — best when the asking
  happens inside a Python app, script, or an interactive session, and when the
  tools should execute themselves.
- **Windows / PowerShell variant** (Windows hosts where PowerShell is the
  ONLY permitted script runtime — no Python, ever): build phases run on a
  Python-capable workstation (or WSL); the deployed instance carries
  `needle_menu.json` + `graph_edges.json` + a generated `bridge.ps1` with
  `[ValidateSet()]`-caged arguments, generated shape-check validators, and
  the engine (`needle.exe`/`neural.exe`, weights `needle3.cact` or
  `neuralOS.engine`) as the selector. Contract is unchanged; Pydantic is
  build-time only. See `references/windows-powershell.md`.
- **Engine runtime** (`--runtime engine`): generates a `tools.json` +
  selection-only bridge for the standalone ~1 MB binary — best for servers,
  edge boxes, and non-Python consumers; execution always stays with the
  caller. Platform bundle bootstrap: the `neuralos-skill` skill's
  `scripts/bootstrap_engine.py`.

Both share the same menu and the same Pydantic-validated bridge.

## Operating rules (inherited from the neuralOS runtime skill)

These are non-negotiable — violating them is what makes small-model agents
unreliable:

1. **Triggers on every menu entry.**
2. **Arguments constrained in the grammar** (patterns, ranges, enums) —
   generated automatically from the profile; do not loosen them without cause.
3. **Tool results small** — counts and digests go to the model; full rows go
   to the caller or a stash file. The generated probes enforce a row cap.
4. **Secrets baked in executors only** — DSN passwords and API keys are written
   into the bridge as constants/env lookups, never as model-facing arguments.
5. **Read-only probes first** — write/update probes are added only after the
   user approves, behind an explicit flag, and always with identity checks.
6. **Verify against the source** — model relays are checked, never trusted.
7. **The graph layer is honest or absent** — edges carry provenance
   (rule + confidence); declared joins that verify with zero value overlap
   become disjoint findings, quoted to the user; the model picks, the bridge
   traverses; graph costs at most 3 menu entries and earns them (a source
   with no real edges gets `graph_overview` alone, or nothing — recorded in
   verification.txt).

Full rationale: `references/instance-standards.md`.

## Deliverables contract

Every completed run leaves behind, in the chosen `--out` directory:
`profile.json`, `graph_edges.json`, `models.py`, `needle_menu.json`,
`bridge.py`, `instance.py`, `README.md`, and a `verification.txt` recording
the Phase-4 results (model coverage %, selection test, truth check, and the
graph gate: edge truth / disjoint honesty / dangling spot-check). If any
piece is missing, the job is not done.

## Script requirements

`profile_data.py` uses only the Python standard library plus `usql`/`sqlite3`
when a database is profiled (openpyxl/pandas are used opportunistically for
XLSX/parquet if installed, with graceful fallbacks). Generated instances
require `pydantic` (v2) and — for the Python runtime — the on-device
`needle` python package installed in the interpreter that runs them.

**Unit tests** (`tests/`, stdlib `unittest`): pin the generator and
graph-layer contracts — tiering, surrogate demotion, cross-column
discovery, alias emission, datetime-never-enum, the duplicate-field-name
dedupe. Run: `python -m unittest discover -s skills/neuralos/tests`.
CI runs them on every push.
